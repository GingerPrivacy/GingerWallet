# Contributing to GingerWallet

Thank you for your interest in contributing to GingerWallet! We appreciate your enthusiasm and support for our project. Below you will find guidelines on how to contribute to our project in a way that aligns with our team’s vision and workflow.

## Our Philosophy

GingerWallet is developed by the GingerPrivacy Team with a specific focus and direction. While we welcome community involvement and value feedback, we primarily manage the development internally to maintain our project's integrity and consistency. Here are the ways you can contribute:

### Reporting Issues

We encourage you to report any bugs, issues, or inconsistencies you encounter while using GingerWallet. To report an issue:

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Before creating a new issue, please check if the issue has already been reported.
2. **Open a New Issue**: If your issue is not listed, feel free to open a new one. Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue, your environment, and any relevant logs or screenshots.

### Feature Requests

We welcome suggestions for new features or improvements to GingerWallet. To request a feature:

1. **Search Existing Requests**: Before making a new request, please check if someone else has already suggested it.
2. **Open a New Request**: If your feature is not listed, open a new request. Clearly describe the feature, its benefits, and any additional context that might help us understand its importance.

### General Discussions

We love hearing from our community! For general discussions, questions, or feedback that don’t fit into issues or feature requests:

1. **Join the Conversation**: Use our discussion forums or community channels to share your thoughts and interact with other GingerWallet users and developers.
2. **Stay Respectful and Constructive**: We aim to foster a friendly and constructive environment. Please be respectful and considerate in your communications.

## Contributions to Code

At this time, we manage the development of GingerWallet internally and do not generally accept pull requests or code contributions. However, in exceptional cases where we explicitly seek help or collaboration, we will make an announcement and provide specific instructions on how to contribute.

## Thank You!

Your support and feedback are invaluable to us. Thank you for using GingerWallet and helping us improve it. We look forward to your participation and contributions through issues, feature requests, and discussions.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us through our community channels.

Happy Walleting!
